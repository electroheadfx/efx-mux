# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-06)

**Core value:** A single native macOS window that co-locates AI agent terminals alongside live GSD progress, git diff, and file tree -- all persisted across restarts via tmux.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — scaffold-entitlements

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (scaffold-entitlements) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 4

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 1]: macOS App Sandbox permanently disabled -- PTY spawning incompatible. Entitlements must be locked in Phase 1.
- [Phase 1]: Arrow.js vendored via import map, no bundler. `component()` returns render functions, not Custom Elements.
- [Phase 2]: PTY streaming via `Channel<Vec<u8>>`, not `emit()`. Binary encoding and Arrow.js `ref` mount require spike verification before production code.
- [Phase 2]: tmux via `std::process::Command` (no Rust crate). xterm.js 6.0 only (no canvas addon, WebGL + DOM fallback).

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: Two spikes required before production code -- `Channel<Vec<u8>>` binary encoding behavior and Arrow.js `ref` attribute in WKWebView. If either fails, architecture must adapt.
- [Phase 2]: tmux not installed by default on macOS. Startup probe needed with user-friendly install prompt.
